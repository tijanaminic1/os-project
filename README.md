2. Round Robin (RR)
3. Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)
4. Shortest Job First (SJF)
5. Highest Ratio Next (HRRN)
6. Custom Algorithm (???)Task B: The CPU Timer

Task B: CPU Timer (Needed for testing of Task A)
 
Task C: Implementing detailed RAM paging
 
Finally, And Most IMPORTANTLY:
Unit Tests
Property Tests
Behavior Tests

Requirements to run code within this project:
