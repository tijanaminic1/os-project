The project thus far seeks to emulate the Z80 CPU, which is the closest CPU
to that used by the original GameBoy handheld console. The actual CPU used
by the GameBoy has little to no documentation, so the GameBoy emulation community
uses the Z80 as an emulation target because of its similar instruction set and
similar hardware specifications.

Requirements to run code within this project:
Python v 3.10 or higher
The Hypothesis Library (tests)
And any requirements arising from Hypothesis
