The project seeks to emulate a basic computer system.
--TODO:
Memory: Luca
DMA: Luca
Interrupts: Luca

Multithreading/Multiprogramming: Luca/Tijana

Mutual Exclusion/Synchronization: Tijana

Advanced Simulation Scenarios: Eric

Meeting: Saturday 11/4 6pm
Meeting: Sunday 11/5 Afternoon (TBD)

Going plan for now is to implement an object called Process,
which is taken into a multithreading process handler, which
then goes to the cpu.

Requirements to run code within this project:
Python v 3.10 or higher
The Hypothesis Library (tests)
And any requirements arising from Hypothesis
