The project seeks to emulate a daily-driver OS in Python. We like to Call it PyOS because it sounds like BIOS even though the ideas aren't closely related.

Requirements to run code within this project:
Python v 3.10 or higher
The Hypothesis Library (tests)
And any requirements arising from Hypothesis
